# Acknowledgment

I’d like to thank professor **Toby Burnett** first for the opportunity and for all his help and inspiration. I’d like also to thank my colleagues, **Eric Wallace**, **Marshall Roth**, and **Matthew Kerr** for their ideas. Special thanks to Marshall for the many bugs he reported and the ideas that made Najm a useful tool!
